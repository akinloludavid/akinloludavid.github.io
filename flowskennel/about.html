		<h1>OUR BRAND STORY - WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO?</h1>
		<p>
	I was about ten years old when I started taking care of dogs. I started with a neighbors dog. This four-legged creature thrilled me. Soon my love for this dog extended to other dogs in my neighborhood. I loved them and cared for them as if they were mine while I longed to have mine.
		</p>
 
		<p>I consider dogs as the most loyal creatures ever formed by God. I love them and I love to care for them. I love to play with them and I love to make them happy. I love to study them and I love to train them.</p>
 
		<p>In my first year at the university, I finally could afford my own dog. It was a great achievement for me. Since then, the journey has been great. I could share the joy of life as much as I wanted with all the dogs in my care.</p>
 
		<p>I believe dogs deserve the best treatment ever. We cannot compensate them enough for their loyalty. I devote more time to them than you can imagine. This is why I started my own kennel.</p>

		<p>I urge you therefore to trust my sincere love for dogs and my long years of experience with them. Flow's kennel is indeed one you can trust.</p>
