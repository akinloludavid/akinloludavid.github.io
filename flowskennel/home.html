		<h1>7 UNKNOWN BENEFITS OF HAVING A DOG</h1>

			<li>
				<p><strong>Dogs are brilliant companions:</strong>There is never a dull moment around dogs.
				It is almost impossible to feel lonely when you have dogs around you. Dogs are very sociable animals and they love being around humans. So whenever you feel bored, grab a toy and spend some time with your pup.

				<p><strong>Dogs can save your life:</strong>Owing to the fact that dogs are very sensitive and intelligent animals, they can detect cancer and other diseases in the body of their owners. There have been stories of pups who continued to lick and sniff at moles or lumps on their human’s bodies, who eventually found out that those skin conditions were cancerous. In fact some dogs are trained to detect cancer within the space of 3 hours.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p><strong>Humans with dogs have a high rate of recovering from sickness:</strong>
					 People recover faster from illnesses and even have higher survival rates after a heart attack if they have a dog. THis is actually a scientifically proven facts.

				<p><strong>They protect their little mates:</strong>
					Children who grow up with dogs have a lower risk of developing eczema than those who have cats or no dogs at all. Also it builds a sense of responsibility in children when they feed and take care of dogs. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Having a dog increases your physical well-being and encourages healthy lifestyle:</strong>
					Dog owners carry a responsibility of training and playing with their dogs. This makes dog owners to be more physically active.
				</p>

				<p><strong>They are a reflection of your personality:</strong>

				</li>

				<h1>GET THE BEST DOGS</h1>
				<p>
					You will agree with me that dogs are cute and adorable domesticated animals. Aside being loyal companions, dogs reduces chances of depression; they make us laugh and keep us more active than the average human companion. Quite a number of them also offer security. I guess that's why we have the saying <em>"as faithful as a dog."</em>.
